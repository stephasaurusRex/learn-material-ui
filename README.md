This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
## Considerations
Since this project was time boxed at 4 hours, focus remained on project structure, correct use of tools/libraries, and production of readable/componentized code.

CSS adjustments were eventually made through use of classes - though if I were doing this for production - a more through investigation of the use and adjustment of material UI themes would have made.

Testing is minimal, again because of time constraints.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
